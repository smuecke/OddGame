<h4 align="center">A mobile game idea</h4>

The objective of this game is to click the *odd one out*, i.e. the only item that is *unique*, as fast as possible. At first this is easy, but as you progress, the odd one out gets much trickier to spot. Have fun!

This game is implemented using [Phaser](https://phaser.io).

## Installation
### Linux

The commendable way:

1. Clone repository to directory `/foo/oddgame`
2. Change into the directory:  
   ```
   cd /foo/oddgame
   ```
3. Start local HTTP server, e.g. using python:  
   ```
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer
   ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to `localhost:8000`

Quick and dirty way:

1. Clone repository
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser

Youâ€™ll probably need to zoom out the page a bit to fit the entire canvas on your screen; the canvas has slightly awkward dimensions because I intend this to become a mobile game, and I just used the screen resolution of my own mobile phone.
